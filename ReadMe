Crypt::PGPSimple ReadMe File

To install the module, simply create a directory in your Perl library
path called Crypt and copy PGPSimple.pm to this directory.  Sorry
there's no installer, but I don't know how to make them at this point!
Please feel free to contribute.  Contact jason@verysimple.com

POD Documentation is embedded in the module.
